## 📊 Model Readiness Assessment

### ✅ **Training Data Ready**

**Current Training Dataset**:
- **64 completed games** with full market data and scores
- **100% market data quality** for training set
- **Complete score data** for outcome validation
- **Perfect data integrity** for model training

**Sample Training Data**:
```
Week 1: DAL @ PHI - Spread: 8.5, Total: 47.5, Result: PHI by 4
Week 1: KC @ LAC - Spread: -3.0, Total: 47.5, Result: LAC by 6
Week 4: SEA @ ARI - Spread: -1.5, Total: 43.5, Result: SEA by 3
```

### 🎯 **Modeling Table Preparation**

**Current Status**:
- ✅ Game-level data ready
- ✅ Market data ready (`spread_line` → `spread_close`)
- ✅ Team identification ready
- ✅ Score data ready for `label_win` creation

**Transformation Needed**:
```python
# Current: Single row per game
game_id | home_team | away_team | spread_line | ...

# Needed: Two rows per game (team-game grain)
game_id | team | opponent | home | spread_close | label_win
```
