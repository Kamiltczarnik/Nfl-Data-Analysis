## Contributing Guidelines

1. Read `Readme` and `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` to understand scope.
2. Before adding files, update `docs/MANIFEST.md` and reference them from docs.
3. Follow `docs/CONVENTIONS.md` for coding and data rules.
4. Prefer configuration over code changes for behavior toggles.
5. Add minimal, testable changes; keep models reproducible (pin seeds, save column order).
