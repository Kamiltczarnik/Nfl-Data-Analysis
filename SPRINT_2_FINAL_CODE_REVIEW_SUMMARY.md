## 🔧 Issues Identified and Resolved

### ✅ Issue 1: Situational Feature Column Naming - RESOLVED

**Problem**: Expected columns `situational_home`, `situational_rest_days`, `situational_spread_close` were missing.

**Root Cause**: Column names were using generic names (`home`, `rest_days`, `spread_close`) instead of prefixed names.

**Solution**: Updated `src/features/situational.py` to use proper column naming:
```python
# Before
'home': True,
'rest_days': home_rest_days,
'spread_close': spread_close,

# After  
'situational_home': True,
'situational_rest_days': home_rest_days,
'situational_spread_close': spread_close,
```

**Result**: ✅ All expected columns now present and correctly named.

### ✅ Issue 2: Configuration Path Structure - VERIFIED CORRECT

**Problem**: Initially appeared that `parquet_lake` path was missing.

**Investigation**: Found that `parquet_lake` path was actually present in `configs/paths.yaml`:
```yaml
data:
  parquet_lake: data/parquet
```

**Result**: ✅ Configuration was already correct, no changes needed.

### ✅ Issue 3: Error Handling Validation - RESOLVED

**Problem**: Invalid inputs (season 1999, week 25) were being processed instead of rejected.

**Root Cause**: No input validation in feature calculators.

**Solution**: Added input validation to both `RollingFeatureCalculator` and `SituationalFeatureCalculator`:
```python
# Input validation
if season < 2000 or season > 2030:
    raise ValueError(f"Invalid season: {season}. Must be between 2000-2030")

if week < 1 or week > 22:
    raise ValueError(f"Invalid week: {week}. Must be between 1-22")
```

**Result**: ✅ Invalid inputs now properly rejected with clear error messages.
